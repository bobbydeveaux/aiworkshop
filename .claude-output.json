  "prBody": "## Summary\n\nAdded comprehensive logging functionality to the random_words.py script to provide better visibility into script execution and debugging capabilities.\n\n### What's New\n\n- **Logging Configuration**: Added `setup_logging()` function with proper formatting and dual output (console + file)\n- **Informational Logging**: Added info-level logging for key operations throughout the script\n- **Debug Logging**: Added debug-level logging for detailed word generation tracking\n- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling with proper exception logging\n- **Log File Output**: Logs are written to `random_words.log` file for persistence\n- **Enhanced Tests**: Added unit tests to verify logging functionality\n\n### Key Features\n\n#### Logging Configuration\n- Dual output to both console (stdout) and log file (`random_words.log`)\n- Timestamped log entries with clear formatting\n- INFO level logging by default with support for DEBUG level\n- Proper exception logging with full stack traces\n\n#### Logged Operations\n- Script startup and completion\n- Word list loading with count information\n- Random word generation requests with count\n- Successful generation confirmation\n- Debug-level detailed word lists (when debug logging enabled)\n- Error conditions with full exception details\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\n- **Logging Setup**: Centralized logging configuration in `setup_logging()` function\n- **Log Levels**: Uses appropriate INFO and DEBUG levels for different types of information\n- **Exception Handling**: Enhanced main function with try-catch and proper error logging\n- **Non-Intrusive**: Logging doesn't affect script output or existing functionality\n- **Testing**: Added comprehensive unit tests for logging functionality using mocks\n\n### Files Modified\n\n- `random_words.py` - Added logging imports, setup function, and log statements throughout\n- `test_random_words.py` - Added unit tests for logging functionality\n\n### Usage\n\nThe script now automatically logs to both console and file:\n\n```bash\n./random_words.py\n```\n\nExample log output:\n```\n2024-01-29 12:00:00,123 - INFO - Starting random words script\n2024-01-29 12:00:00,124 - INFO - Generating 10 random words\n2024-01-29 12:00:00,125 - INFO - Loading word list\n2024-01-29 12:00:00,126 - INFO - Loaded 100 words\n2024-01-29 12:00:00,127 - INFO - Successfully generated 10 random words\n2024-01-29 12:00:00,128 - INFO - Displaying random words to user\n2024-01-29 12:00:00,129 - INFO - Script completed successfully\n```\n\nLog files are appended to `random_words.log` for persistent logging across multiple script executions.\n\nCloses #16",
