# Product Requirements Document: Build a REST API for managing todo items with CRUD operations

**Created:** 2026-02-02T15:36:14Z
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Overview

**Concept:** Build a REST API for managing todo items with CRUD operations

**Description:** Build a REST API for managing todo items with CRUD operations

---

## 2. Goals

<!-- AI: Based on the concept and clarification Q&A, list 3-5 primary goals. Each goal should be specific and measurable. -->

- Provide a RESTful API that supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for todo items
- Enable clients to manage todo items with a simple, intuitive HTTP interface
- Ensure API responses follow REST conventions with appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON payloads
- Support listing all todo items and retrieving individual items by identifier
- Deliver a functional API that can be integrated with frontend applications or third-party services

---

## 3. Non-Goals

<!-- AI: List 3-5 explicit non-goals to set boundaries. -->

- Building a user interface or frontend client for the API
- Implementing user authentication or authorization mechanisms
- Supporting real-time notifications or webhooks for todo item changes
- Providing multi-tenancy or user-specific todo lists
- Implementing advanced features like tags, categories, priorities, or due dates beyond basic todo properties

---

## 4. User Stories

<!-- AI: Generate 5-10 user stories in the format: "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]" -->

- As an API consumer, I want to create a new todo item so that I can add tasks to my list
- As an API consumer, I want to retrieve all todo items so that I can view my complete task list
- As an API consumer, I want to retrieve a specific todo item by ID so that I can view its details
- As an API consumer, I want to update an existing todo item so that I can modify task details or mark items as complete
- As an API consumer, I want to delete a todo item so that I can remove completed or unnecessary tasks
- As a developer, I want clear HTTP status codes returned so that I can handle responses appropriately in my client application
- As a developer, I want consistent JSON response formats so that I can reliably parse API responses
- As an API consumer, I want to receive error messages in a structured format so that I can understand what went wrong
- As a frontend developer, I want well-defined API endpoints so that I can easily integrate the API into my application

---

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

<!-- AI: For each major user story, define acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format -->

**Create Todo Item**
- Given valid todo item data in the request body
- When a POST request is sent to the todos endpoint
- Then a new todo item is created and returned with a 201 status code and unique ID

**Retrieve All Todo Items**
- Given todo items exist in the system
- When a GET request is sent to the todos endpoint
- Then all todo items are returned with a 200 status code in JSON format

**Retrieve Single Todo Item**
- Given a todo item exists with a specific ID
- When a GET request is sent to the todos endpoint with that ID
- Then the specific todo item is returned with a 200 status code

**Retrieve Non-Existent Todo Item**
- Given a todo item does not exist for the requested ID
- When a GET request is sent with that ID
- Then a 404 status code is returned with an appropriate error message

**Update Todo Item**
- Given a todo item exists and valid update data is provided
- When a PUT or PATCH request is sent to the todos endpoint with the ID
- Then the todo item is updated and returned with a 200 status code

**Delete Todo Item**
- Given a todo item exists with a specific ID
- When a DELETE request is sent to the todos endpoint with that ID
- Then the todo item is removed and a 204 or 200 status code is returned

**Invalid Request Handling**
- Given invalid or malformed data in the request
- When any API request is made
- Then a 400 status code is returned with a descriptive error message

---

## 6. Functional Requirements

<!-- AI: List specific functional requirements (FR-001, FR-002, etc.) -->

**FR-001**: The API shall provide a POST endpoint to create new todo items with properties including title, description, and completion status

**FR-002**: The API shall provide a GET endpoint to retrieve all todo items in a JSON array format

**FR-003**: The API shall provide a GET endpoint with an ID parameter to retrieve a single todo item

**FR-004**: The API shall provide a PUT or PATCH endpoint to update existing todo items by ID

**FR-005**: The API shall provide a DELETE endpoint to remove todo items by ID

**FR-006**: Each todo item shall have a unique identifier automatically generated by the system

**FR-007**: The API shall return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 404, 500) based on operation results

**FR-008**: The API shall return responses in JSON format with consistent structure

**FR-009**: The API shall validate required fields for todo items (e.g., title) and return validation errors for missing or invalid data

**FR-010**: The API shall handle errors gracefully and return structured error messages in JSON format

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- The API shall respond to read requests (GET) within 200ms under normal load
- The API shall respond to write requests (POST, PUT, DELETE) within 500ms under normal load
- The API shall handle at least 100 concurrent requests without degradation
- The API shall support pagination for large todo lists if the dataset exceeds 1000 items

### Security
- The API shall validate all input data to prevent injection attacks
- The API shall use HTTPS for all communications in production environments
- The API shall implement rate limiting to prevent abuse (optional but recommended)
- The API shall sanitize error messages to avoid exposing sensitive system information

### Scalability
- The API architecture shall support horizontal scaling by adding more server instances
- The API shall use stateless request handling to enable load balancing
- The database layer shall be abstracted to support future migration to distributed databases
- The API shall support caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data

### Reliability
- The API shall maintain 99% uptime during business hours
- The API shall log all errors with sufficient detail for debugging
- The API shall implement graceful degradation when dependencies are unavailable
- The API shall include health check endpoints for monitoring
